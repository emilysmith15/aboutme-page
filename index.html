<h3>A few things about me...</h3>
<p>I am a first semester student here at the Craig Newmark School of Journalism and I am interested in arts and culture reporting along with local accountability, as well as the intersections between the two. I am excited about pursuing journalism while still being able to work with the amazing people in the food service industry. Food is political and I want to share that with everyone (ideally through audio mediums).</p>

<p>These are my top 3 favorite stories:</p>
<ol>
	<li>The politics of hummus: Israel's search for cultural identity - <a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/hummus-politics-israels-search-cultural-identity"target="blank">Middle East Eye</a></li>
	<p>This piece from Emad Moussa was one of the works that introduced me to food anthropology and politics. Israeli appropriation of Palestinian cuisine is an interesting case study when it comes to the topic, and, now, an increasingly relevent one.</p>
	<li>The Voice of the NYC Subway is a Trans Woman With an Inspiring Story - <a href="https://www.them.us/story/nyc-subway-voice-mta-announcements-trans-woman-bernie-wagenblast"target="blank">Them</a></li>
	<p> I found this piece while working for the Interruptrr newsletter and contributing to its Pride Month edition. I feel as though it's important to highlight wins in the queer community, especially when many of the "newsworthy" moments in queer news happen when our rights are being relinquished.</p>
	<li>How we finally got a table at Rao's -- and everything we ate - <a href="https://www.theinfatuation.com/new-york/reviews/raos" target="blank">The Infatuation</a></li>
	<p> This piece is a fun exporation of a restaurant in East Harlem that introduced "table rights" in the '70s, and where, as a result, it is almost impossible to get a table. These journalists visited the restaurant a couple of times before they were able to secure a table, and in the process, met the patrons and one of the co-owners.</p>
</ol>

<h4> Bye bye for now <3 </h4>
